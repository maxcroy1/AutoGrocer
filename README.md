# AutoGrocer

**IN PROGRESS**

**AutoGrocer** is a web application that allows users to automate one of the most important, yet monotonous errands out there - grocery shopping. 

AutoGrocer utilizes users’ existing Instacart credentials to automate their grocery shopping at a cadence of their choice. 

## Motivation
**AutoGrocer** is my capstone project for Flatiron School’s Software Engineering Immersive Course. 

I often forget to order my groceries ahead of time, and have been desperately looking for a way to automate such an important task. Since the feature doesn’t exist on Instacart, I figured I would build it out myself.
